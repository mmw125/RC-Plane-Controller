Mainly here for my resume. I will answer questions if you have any on this project.

#Overview
This is a project I worked on in high school. The processing code is run on the computer that has an xbee and can have
a controller plugged in. The xbee provides a seril link through an xbee to the arduino on the plane. The plane sends information from its 
sensors and the computer tells the aiplane how to move its servos.
